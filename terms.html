This includes the replacement, rectification and repair services for Covered Repairs required due to normal wear and tear. The Customer becomes entitled to Covered Repairs pursuant to their Plan(s) after the first payment is received and continues thereafter for the duration of their Plan(s).<br />
                            In the event of non-payment, the Customer will be notified of the non-payment. If the Customer fails to rectify this, the Plan(s) shall be suspended at the end of the Term and thus, so will the Covered Repairs. Services will be automatically renewed upon receipt of payment from the Customer indicating a new Term and thus so will the Terms and Conditions herein. Once a Service Request has been executed, No refunds will be provided for any Cancellations during the Term. All Plan(s) are linked to a specific address.<br />
                        Parties agree that these Terms and Conditions do not give rise to an insurance contract.

                            <b>Non-Covered Repair Quotation</b>: means the quote submitted by the Service Desk to the Customer prior to undertaking any Non-Covered Repair work. The quotation will contain information identifying the Non-Covered Repairs and the charges. Once the quotation is approved by the Customer, a Beaver Home Manager will then undertake the Non-Covered Repairs. Approval by the Customer amounts to an acceptance of the charges associated with the Non-Covered Repairs. Based on the approval received from the Customer, Beaver will issue an invoice for the Customer’s immediate payment which is separate from any amounts paid or payable as per the Plan(s). Payment must be made before the execution of any Non-Covered Repairs.
